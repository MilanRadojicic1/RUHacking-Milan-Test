about:
  col_1:
    description: "A **Hackathon **is a programming marathon, where teams of 2-4 put their ideas together to create something exciting in only 24 hours. It gives teams of hackers a chance to turn their ideas into reality and present them.\r\n\nThere will be a number of prizes for using specific technologies as well as the overall best project. There will be additional prize pools available exclusively to first-timers!"
    title: What is a Hackathon anyway?
  col_2:
    description: "To attend as a hacker, you must be in full-time education (e.g. University, college) or have finished in the past year. We have no other requirements!\r\n\nWe welcome attendees from all disciplines as we strongly believe Hackathon projects require skills beyond just technical - benefiting from skills such as design, entrepreneurship and overall creativity."

    R. U. Hacking? works hard to provide our members with strong links to local
    industry leaders, that's why we actively seek industry partners to come and
    provide talks and workshops at our events. This offers an excellent platform
    for our students to create ties with businesses while at University and get
    a good foothold for when looking for placements.
